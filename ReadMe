Social engineering is the manipulation of individuals to obtain their sensitive
information. As the number of individuals being targeted by social engineering continues to
increase, there is a growing need for online awareness programs. Thus, our team decided to
develop a simple game on the awareness of social engineering. The game presents couple real-world
scenarios of social engineering attacks by email, prompting users to interact with these scenarios.
Ultimately, the game aims to increase individualsâ€™ awareness and safeguard them from online threats in
an enjoyable, interactive experience.Our game is for spreading awareness for the users when
receiving emils.In our game we used Blender to create the character. Our character is a 3D
character. The character appears to the user when responding to an email. Our goal with
CyberSafe is to warn the user against clicking on suspicious emails and to verify the
authenticity of the email before clicking on it. Therefore, this is more educational than
entertaining. For the environment, we used Unity. The first environment is the user 
in the office at work. and the second environment is the useris an aramco employeer at
home in his vecation.
